title: Getting Started with NanoPack
---

To start using NanoPack in your project, you need two things:

- Install `nanoc` ([instructions here](/guides/generating-code))
- Install the language support library, currently only C++, Swift, and TypeScript are supported. ([instructions here, scroll down to Support Library section](/guides/generating-code))
