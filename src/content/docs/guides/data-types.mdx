NanoPack supports the following data types out of the box.

## Number types

NanoPack supports the following data types:

- 8-bit signed/unsigned integers: `int8`/`uiut8`
- 32-bit signed/unsigned integers: `int32`/`uint32`
- 64-bit signed/unsigned integers: `int64`/`uint64`
- Double-precision floating-points: (Doubles): `double`

## Strings

NanoPack also supports UTF8-encoded strings. Use `string` as the type keyword.

## Booleans

Use `bool` to denote a boolean type.

## Arrays

NanoPack supports arrays of any NanoPack types. Simply add a pair of square brackets `[]` to the end of a type to make
it an array of that type.
For example, a string array is declared as `string[]`.

NanoPack also supports nested arrays. `string[][]`, for example, declares an array of string arrays.

## Maps

NanoPack supports maps as well. Only strings and number types can be used as map keys, but map values can be of any
type.

To declare a map type, use the following syntax:

```
<key-type:value-type>
```

For example, to declare a field `my_field` that stores map of string to 32-bit integers:

```yaml
my_field: <string:int32>
```

## Optional

A type can be made optional by adding a question mark (`?`) at the end of a type:

```yaml
# an optional array of string
field_1: string[]?

# an array of optional strings
field_2: string?[]
```

Except keys of maps, any type can be made optional.

## Messages

NanoPack supports using other NanoPack messages as types.
A message field can store a message of another message type, or even of its own type (recursive types).

To use another message as a type, simply use its name as the type name. No import statement is required to make it
available.

:::note
- If you use other messages as types, make sure their schema files are compiled together with the schema file they are
used in
- Fields that have recursive types (i.e. fields that use the message it is in as its type) are automatically marked as
optional.

### Any message

If you want to store *any* NanoPack message, use `message` as the type.

## Enums

A field can also store any user-defined enums. Use the name of the enum as the type. No import statement is required.

## Any

A field can be of any arbitrary type by specifying the type as `any`. How the `any` type is handled depends on the programming language. Refer to the corresponding language guide for more details.

:::caution
Avoid using `any` as it is quite unoptimized at the moment

## Combining Different Data Types.

Here is an example of combining different types:

```yaml
CrazyMessage:
  # Array of map of string to int32
  field_1: <string:int32>[]

  # Map of int32 to string arrays
  field_2: <int32:string[]>

  # Array of map of strings to string arrays
  field_3: <string:string[]>[]

  # Map of strings to map of int32 to int8
  field_4: <string:<int32:int8>>
```
