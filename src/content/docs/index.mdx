	<Card title="Optimized for read/write performance" icon="rocket">
		While NanoPack is not the most space efficient, it is optimized for serialization/deserialization speed, making it faster than popular serialization formats, such as Protobuf.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Easy schema syntax" icon="document">
		NanoPack schema is designed to be easy to read and write. No more field numbers or import statements!
	</Card>
	<Card title="RPC" icon="puzzle">
		NanoPack has built-in support for RPC. Define your RPC services in NanoPack schemas, and NanoPack will generate the glue code for setting up RPC clients and servers.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Work in progress!" icon="warning">
		NanoPack is still a work-in-progress, so expect rough edges, and please don't hesitate to report any issue you come across!
